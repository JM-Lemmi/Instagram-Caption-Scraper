# Instagram-Caption-Scraper
Scrape Instagram post captions

A simple scraper which allows you to go through an Instagram user's post captions and filter out the posts containing specific substring.

For example, I could go through <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nasa/">@NASA</a>'s posts to see how many times they mention International Space Station.
